## What WIPP Is

WIPP (Work In Progress) is a community-first space designed for artists to share their work and receive structured, opt-in feedback. We're a learning platform that simulates the supportive environment of art studios and classrooms, not a social media platform focused on engagement or viral content.

WIPP is provided as-is, without guarantees of growth, exposure, feedback quality, or any specific outcomes. We facilitate connections between artists but do not guarantee results.

## Who Can Use WIPP

You must be at least 13 years old to use WIPP. If you're under 18, you should have permission from a parent or guardian.

By creating an account, you confirm that you meet these age requirements and have the authority to enter into this agreement.

## Your Responsibilities

When you use WIPP, you agree to:

- Provide accurate information when creating your account
- Keep your login credentials secure
- Only share work that you own or have permission to share
- Respect other artists and their work
- Follow our Community Guidelines
- Not use WIPP for commercial promotion without permission
- Not attempt to circumvent our systems or policies

## Your Content and Ownership

You own all the work you upload to WIPP. We don't claim ownership of your art, writing, or other creative content.

However, by uploading content to WIPP, you grant us a limited license to:

- Display your work on the platform
- Allow other users to view and provide feedback on your work
- Make technical copies necessary for the platform to function
- Show your work in connection with your profile and feedback requests

This license only lasts while your content is on WIPP and ends when you delete it. You can remove your work at any time.

## Feedback and Critique

All feedback on WIPP is:

- **Subjective** - These are personal opinions, not objective truths
- **Optional** - You choose whether to request and apply feedback
- **Not professional advice** - Feedback comes from community members, not certified professionals
- **Your choice** - You decide how to use any feedback you receive

WIPP is not responsible for the quality, accuracy, or outcomes of any feedback you receive. We facilitate the exchange but don't endorse or guarantee any specific advice.

## Our Moderation Rights

To maintain a safe and supportive community, we may:

- Remove content that violates our guidelines
- Suspend or terminate accounts that repeatedly break our rules
- Modify or remove features as needed
- Update these terms and our policies

Our moderation exists to protect the community and maintain the supportive environment artists need, not to punish creativity or expression.

## Account Suspension and Termination

We may suspend or terminate your account if you:

- Repeatedly violate our Community Guidelines
- Engage in harassment or harmful behavior
- Attempt to circumvent our systems
- Use WIPP in ways that harm other users or the platform

You can also delete your account at any time through your settings.

## No Guarantees

WIPP does not guarantee:

- That you'll receive feedback on your work
- The quality or usefulness of any feedback
- Increased exposure or career opportunities
- That the platform will always be available
- That all features will work perfectly at all times

We're an early-stage platform working to improve, but we can't promise specific outcomes.

## Limitation of Liability

WIPP is provided "as is" without warranties. We're not liable for:

- Any damages resulting from your use of the platform
- Loss of work due to technical issues (always keep backups)
- Disputes between users
- Any outcomes from feedback received or given

Our liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## Changes to These Terms

We may update these terms as WIPP grows and evolves. When we make significant changes, we'll notify you through the platform or by email.

Continued use of WIPP after changes means you accept the updated terms.
