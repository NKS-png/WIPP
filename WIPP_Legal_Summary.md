# WIPP Legal Documents - Plain English Summary

## What These Documents Are For

These legal documents exist to protect you, other artists, and the WIPP community. They're not here to intimidate or create barriers - they're here to make sure everyone understands how WIPP works and what we're all agreeing to when we use the platform together.

## Our Core Values

Everything in these documents reflects three key principles:

### Trust Over Engagement
We're not trying to maximize your time on the platform or create addictive features. We want to create a space where artists can trust that their work and feedback requests will be respected.

### Learning Over Performance
WIPP is designed for growth and education, not for going viral or building a personal brand. The rules reflect this focus on genuine artistic development.

### Community Over Competition
We believe artists grow best when they support each other. Our guidelines prioritize maintaining a supportive community over individual gains.

- **Clarity:** Everyone knows what to expect and what's expected of them
- **Protection:** Both artists and WIPP are protected from misunderstandings
- **Trust:** Clear rules help build the trust necessary for vulnerable creative sharing
- **Growth:** As WIPP evolves, these documents provide a stable foundation
