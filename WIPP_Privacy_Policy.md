We only share your information when:

These services have their own privacy policies and security measures.

You can disable cookies in your browser, but some WIPP features may not work properly.

We don't use tracking cookies for advertising or sell data to advertisers.

## Security Measures

We protect your information through:
- Encrypted connections (HTTPS)
- Secure password storage
- Regular security updates
- Limited access to user data
- Monitoring for suspicious activity

However, no online service is 100% secure. We encourage you to use strong, unique passwords and report any suspicious activity.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy as WIPP evolves. When we make significant changes, we'll notify you through:
- A notice on the platform
- Email to your registered address
- Updates to this page with a new "Last Updated" date
