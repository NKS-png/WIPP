# Community Guidelines

**Effective Date:** [Date]

## Our Community Values

WIPP is built on the foundation of how artists actually learn and grow together - through trust, respect, and structured feedback. These guidelines reflect the culture of supportive art studios and classrooms, not the chaos of social media.

We believe in protecting creativity while fostering genuine learning and connection.

## The Golden Rule: Opt-In Critique Only

**Never give unsolicited critique on portfolio posts.**

This is our most important rule. Artists share work for many reasons - to celebrate progress, document their journey, or simply share what they're proud of. Unless someone specifically asks for feedback, assume they're not looking for critique.

### When Feedback is Welcome:
- Posts explicitly asking for critique or advice
- Work shared in feedback-focused spaces
- When an artist directly asks you for your thoughts

### When to Hold Back:
- Portfolio posts without feedback requests
- Work shared as celebration or documentation
- When you're not sure if feedback is wanted

**When in doubt, ask first:** "Would you like some thoughts on this?" or "Are you looking for feedback?"

## Respectful and Constructive Feedback

When feedback is requested, make it count:

### Good Feedback:
- **Specific:** "The lighting in the top-left creates nice depth" rather than "looks good"
- **Actionable:** "Try varying your line weights to create more visual hierarchy"
- **Balanced:** Acknowledge what's working along with suggestions
- **Respectful:** Remember there's a person behind the work

### Avoid:
- Harsh or dismissive language
- Comparing work to other artists negatively
- Focusing only on what's "wrong"
- Making assumptions about the artist's skill level or intentions

Remember: feedback is labor. If someone asks for critique, they're asking for your time and expertise. Make it worthwhile.

## No Harassment or Personal Attacks

WIPP has zero tolerance for:

- Personal attacks or insults
- Harassment based on identity, background, or artistic choices
- Bullying or intimidating behavior
- Hate speech or discriminatory language
- Doxxing or sharing personal information without consent

Disagreeing with someone's artistic choices is fine. Attacking them as a person is not.

## Respect Intellectual Property

### Your Own Work:
- Only share work you created or have permission to share
- Don't upload copyrighted material you don't own
- Be honest about collaborations and references

### Others' Work:
- Don't repost other artists' work without clear permission
- Don't claim others' work as your own
- Give credit when sharing references or inspiration
- Respect when artists ask not to have their work shared

## No Unsolicited Critique on Portfolio Posts

This bears repeating because it's so important to our community culture.

Portfolio posts are for:
- Sharing completed work
- Documenting artistic journey
- Celebrating progress and achievements
- Building a body of work

They are not automatic invitations for critique. Treat them like pieces in a gallery - you can appreciate and comment positively, but don't assume the artist wants your suggestions for improvement.

## Accountability and Growth

We all make mistakes. When someone points out that your behavior was harmful:

- Listen with an open mind
- Apologize sincerely if you caused harm
- Learn from the experience
- Do better going forward

We're all here to grow as artists and people. Part of that growth involves learning how to interact respectfully in creative communities.

## Moderation Philosophy

Our moderation exists to protect the community and maintain the supportive environment artists need to thrive. We're not here to punish creativity or police artistic expression.

### We Will Act When:
- Someone repeatedly ignores the opt-in critique rule
- Harassment or personal attacks occur
- Intellectual property is violated
- Behavior threatens the safety of community members

### Our Approach:
- **Education first:** Many issues come from misunderstanding our culture
- **Proportional response:** Minor issues get gentle corrections, serious problems get stronger action
- **Community focus:** We prioritize protecting the overall community environment

## Reporting Issues

If you see behavior that violates these guidelines:

1. **Direct approach:** If you feel safe doing so, politely let the person know about the issue
2. **Report to moderators:** Use the report function or contact us directly
3. **Provide context:** Help us understand what happened and why it's concerning

We take all reports seriously and investigate them promptly.

## Building the Community We Want

These guidelines aren't just rules - they're a description of the community we're building together. Every interaction shapes WIPP's culture.

### You Can Help By:
- Modeling respectful behavior
- Welcoming new artists warmly
- Asking before giving critique
- Celebrating others' growth and achievements
- Speaking up (kindly) when you see issues

## Questions About These Guidelines

If you're unsure whether something violates these guidelines, feel free to ask. We'd rather have you check than accidentally harm the community.
